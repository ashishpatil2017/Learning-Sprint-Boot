Spring MVC Controller :
-Its another proojector in spring framework 
-Spring mvc checks the incoming request from user and  checks if its get,put,post 
-if there is request matching in controller then it maps tht reuqest with java functionality 
-and later it maps with proper response 
-spring mvc automatically did the java to json conversion (it has inbuild functionality)



RestAPI that we are building here :
-It has three resource Topic , Courses and Lessons 
-Each topic can have multiple course and each course have multiple lessons 
-Lets consider the example of topcis and start

For Topic we can have following services :
get     /topics      gets all topics
get     /topics/id   gets one topic 
post    /topics      create new topic
put     /topicd/id   updates the topic 
delete  /topics/id   deletes the topic


creating business services:
refer code base 

different annotations with there use :
@Service : this is a class level annotation, this is used when we want to make any class as service class 
@RestController : This is a class level annotation, this is used when we want to make any class as controller 
@Autowired : It injects the dependecies being used .
@RequestMapping : to route perticular request to this followng code (value and method)
