What is maven Project:
-Maven in a java project helps for projects build,dependencies and documentation
-While executing any project, maven searches for pom.xml in the current directory and reads the configuration information 
 and executs the project 
-there were different project in a company and all we need to build together. Each of the project contains ant build files 
and each projects ant file is different. We need some standard way to build all these projects and share jars across each project 
hence maven came into existence.
-Maven can be used to build and manage java based projects
